# Emergency Callbox Optimization

## Project Overview

Situated around the McGill campus are emergency callboxes. These are installed and maintained by the McGill security team to help students and the general public get help in case of an emergency. They can be spotted by their bright colours and blue light attached to them. Some of these phones are outdated or in suboptimal locations and it would be beneficial for the McGill security team to optimization their location and type. Note: since the widespread use of mobile phones these boxes have shifted more to a general-purpose security element. They provide light and surveillance to many areas of campus and are constantly monitored by the security team on campus. See the photo below for an example callbox.
